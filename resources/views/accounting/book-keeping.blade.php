        <p class="paragraph">Bookkeeping is a systematic record of financial transactions in the appropriate books of
            records. What it means is, whether you make a sale or purchase something, a record will be maintained of the
            transaction. This record will allow you to easily keep a track of all your transactions and will help you
            analyse how you can cut costs and reduce taxes. Bookkeeping is a function of the accounts department of a
            business. However, many small businesses do not have fully staffed and efficient accounting departments and
            require the help of external bookkeeping services. LegalRaasta can help your business maintain its books
            through its network of CA/CSs and tax experts.</p>

                            use of double-entry journal accounting to ensure that the Trial Balance is correct. As a
                            private limited company, whether you have one member or fifty members, the compliance,
                            accountability and accuracy should be the same.</div>

                        <div class="toggle_title">6. Why should I choose LegalRaasta for Bookkeeping Services?</div>

                            service portals to help factories and establishments to receive bookkeeping services in

                        <div class="toggle_title">7. Whatâ€™s the difference between a bookkeeping service and an
                            accountant?</div>
                        <div class="toggle_content" style="display: none;">A bookkeeper puts together a complete
                            database of your businessâ€™ income and expenses for your financial year. On the other hand,
                            an accountant takes the bookkeeping data and creates the necessary books of accounts for tax
                            compliance. The danger here is that the work of the bookkeeper has a direct affect on the
                            work of the accountant. If the books of accounts are wrong, then the accounting reports will
                            also be wrong. Hence, the importance of using a first-rate bookkeeping service is key to the
                            success of your business.</div>
                        <div class="toggle_title">8. Is it okay if I keep my receipts and show them to my Accountant at
                            the end of the year?</div>
                        <div class="toggle_content" style="display: none;">Bookkeeping is relatively inexpensive and is
                            crucial to the success of your business. It is important to keep an accurate record of your
                            income and expenses, so you can make the right decisions at the right time thus reducing
                            preventable losses. Small businesses are especially vulnerable in this area as they perceive
                            great compensation from this exercise but underestimate the true value of labour and
                            materials required. You would be better off with a bookkeeping service that will accept your
                            receipts every two months and keep you profitable.</div>
                        <div class="toggle_title">9. I had a sole-proprietorship and incorporated a Private Limited
                            Company mid-way through the year. How does this affect my bookkeeping?</div>
                        <div class="toggle_content" style="display: none;">You must treat these as two separate
                            businesses with two separate books of accounts. It is simple and clear rule that each
                            business has its own books of accounts and<a
                                href="https://www.legalraasta.com/gst-registration/">GST registration as well</a> as
                            well. Also, each business requires its own separate business bank account.</div>
                        <div class="toggle_title">10. What all the things need to be maintained in the books of
                            accounts?</div>
                        <div class="toggle_content" style="display: none;">Books of accounts comprise of a Journal, a
                            Ledger book, a Trial Balance, Original and carbon copies of bills/invoices/receipts /, Cash
                            Book, Profit and Loss A/c, Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Statements.</div>
                        <div class="toggle_title">11. Is there a legal requirement to maintain books of accounts?</div>
                        <div class="toggle_content" style="display: none;">Companies and LLPs are required to maintain
                            books of accounts as mandated by their governing statutes, namely Companies Act, 2013 and
                            Limited Liability Partnership Act, 2008. Further, Income Tax Act, 1961 also obligates the
                            maintenance of the books of accounts, irrespective of the form of business, and has separate
                            provisions related to it. Thus, there may be a situation where a Private Limited Company is
                            required to comply with such legal provisions as well.</div>
                        <div class="toggle_title toggle_active">12. If Iâ€™m recording all my financial transactions

                            accounts/pay slips/vouchers, am I accounting all my transactions?</div>
                        <div class="toggle_content" style="display: block;">Yes, you are on the right track as you that
                            would imply that you are preparing a part of books of accounts. But it does not cover all
                            your transactions, so in order to keep records of all the transaction you need to maintain
                            additional books of accounts like Journal, Ledger, Trial Balance, Cash Book, P&amp;L A/c,
                            Balance Sheet and Cash-flow Statements in commonly accepted accounting software, such as
                            Tally or Oracle.</div>
                        <div class="toggle_title">13. If I maintain books of accounts with the help of a professional
                            firm, is it mandatory for me to get my accounts audited? If yes, what is the frequency of
                            audit?</div>
                        <div class="toggle_content" style="display: none;">Maintaining or not maintaining books by
                            handing over the job to a professional firm does not determine whether you need to undergo
                            audit or not. Furthermore, there are several different types of audits such as, internal
                            audit, cost audit, tax audit and statutory audit. Each audit has its own statutory
                            requirements, thresholds of being conducted with relevant deadlines and due dates.</div>
                        <div class="toggle_title">14. Is there any difference between accounting and accounting
                            standards?</div>
                        <div class="toggle_content" style="display: none;">If accounting is the product, accounting
                            standards are its manual. Accounting standards are enacted and published by The Institute of
                            Chartered Accountants of India which are meant to be followed by businesses for true and
                            fair recording of their transactions. All accounting standards are not mandatory for all
                            forms of businesses. Simply put, the bigger your business, the number of accounting
                            standards which need to be followed.</div>
                        <div class="toggle_title">15. Do I have the option of not maintaining any books of accounts if
                            Iâ€™m incurring losses in the early phases of my business?</div>
                        <div class="toggle_content" style="display: none;">No, you donâ€™t have that option since you are
                            legally required to maintain books of accounts irrespective of profits or losses. Not
                            earning revenue cannot be an excuse for non-maintenance of books of accounts. In fact, as
                            long as you are entering into financial transactions, you need to record the same. Another
                            reason for maintaining books of accounts in the years of losses is that you can file income
                            tax returns for the same and claim the benefit of setting off losses in the future years of
                            profit.</div>
                        <div class="toggle_title">16. Can I have the option of recording my transactions manually or is
                            it obligatory to record it through any specific software?</div>
                        <div class="toggle_content" style="display: none;">Yes, you have an option of manually recording
                            your transaction. It is not at all obligatory to do it through any specific software. But
                            itâ€™s always advisable to maintain accounts on a specific software to eliminate any errors or
                            miscalculations.</div>
                        <div class="toggle_title">17. I am a salaried individual in an MNC and a director in a family
                            owned business. Can I account for the transactions made by me in the capacity as an
                            â€˜employeeâ€™ and for being the director in a businessâ€™ in the same books of accounts?</div>
                        <div class="toggle_content" style="display: none;">No. An individual and a business are two
                            completely separate legal entities. You may be a major shareholder of the business and an
                            employee at the same time, but you cannot mix your own account with the accounts of the MNC.
                            You have to be very clear about the fact that once you transfer anything owned by you to the
                            business, it will from then onwards be treated business property. Hence, separate accounts
                            should be maintained for individuals and businesses. Its would be a prudent practice to
                            maintain separate bank accounts also to ensure flexibility and transparency.</div>
