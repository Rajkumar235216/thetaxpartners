    <h1>Section 154 of the Income Tax Act</h1></div><div class="cc__bodytext text-left" data-cms-attr="class:ccbodytextClass" data-cms-content="md:ccbodytext"><p>In some cases, it may so happen that an order containing mistakes is passed by the assessing officer. Section 154 provides an opportunity for the assessing officer to rectify any mistake or error that was done by him. It allows the officer to correct mistakes done by him.

It is a rectification of mistake apparent from records. Orders issued under Sections 143(1), 200A (1) and 206CB (1) can be rectified. However, only those mistakes can be rectified that are apparent from the record. Section 143(1) deals with summary assessment; it is a notice issued post-filing of return. Section 200A (1) and 206CB (1) deal with intimations issued for error in TDS and TCS statements. This rectification of mistakes shall be done only after a return has been filed by the assessee; such return has been processed and an intimation is received by the taxpayer and such intimation has errors or mistake.</p>
