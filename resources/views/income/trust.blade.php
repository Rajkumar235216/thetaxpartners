<div class="fsize16"><p style="text-align: justify;">Section 12A registration is one time exemption obtained by most Trusts, right after incorporation to be exempted from paying income tax. Trusts and NGOs having 12A registration enjoy exemption from paying income tax on the surplus income of the Trust or NGO. Income tax exemption is available for all <a href="https://taxguru.in/income-tax/taxation-of-non-profit-organisations-chapter-vi-under-the-revised-direct-tax-code.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>non-profit NGOs</strong></a>. Hence, it is important for all Trusts, NGOs and other Not-for-Profit organizations to be aware of Section 12A of Income Tax Act and obtain the same, soon after incorporation of the Trust or NGO.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Benefits of 12A Registration</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The benefits of Section 12A Registration are as follows.</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>The fund that is used for the charitable or religious purposes is considered to be the income application. The income application is nothing but the expenses used for charitable or religious purposes when calculating the income of the trust.</li>
<li>The income received will be free from taxation.</li>
<li>The person registered under this section can avail benefits for accumulating or setting aside income which is not more than&nbsp;15% for the charitable or religious purposes.</li>
<li>The accumulation of income, that is considered to be the income application according to Section 11(2) will not be included in the total income.</li>
<li>The registration that is made under Section 12A, is a one-time registration. Once the registration is made, it will be active till the date of cancellation of the registration. There is no requirement of renewing the registration. Therefore, these benefits can be claimed whenever required by the NGO.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Eligibility for 12A Registration</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Only Charitable Trusts, Religious Trusts, Societies and companies that come under Section 8 are eligible for 12A registration. 12A registration is not applicable for Private or Family Trust.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Form 10A â€“ Income Tax</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Charitable Trusts, Religious Trusts, Societies and Section 8 Companies claiming exemption under Section 11 and 12 of the Income Tax Act, must obtain 12A registration. Private or family trusts are not allowed such exemptions and cannot obtain 12A registration. The process for applying for 12A registration and Form 10A filing has been made online only with the&nbsp;digital signature&nbsp;of the signatory.&nbsp;To obtain 12A Registration, an application in&nbsp;Form 10A&nbsp;for registration of charitable or religious trust or institution must be made online to the Commissioner of Income Tax along with the following documents.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;">1. Where the trust is created, or the institution is established, under an instrument, self-certified copy of the instrument creating the trust or establishing the institution;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;">2. Where the trust is created, or the institution is established, otherwise than under an instrument, self-certified copy of the document evidencing the creation of the trust, or establishment of the institution;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;">3. Self-certified copy of registration with Registrar of Companies or Registrar of Firms and Societies or Registrar of Public Trusts, as the case may be;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;">4. Self-certified copy of the documents evidencing adoption or modification of the objects, if any;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;">5. Where the trust or institution has been in existence during any year or years prior to the financial year in which the application for registration is made, self-certified copies of the annual accounts of the trust or institution relating to such prior year or years (not being more than three years immediately preceding the year in which the said application is made) for which such accounts have been made up;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;">6. Note on the activities of the trust or institution;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;">7. Self-certified copy of existing order granting registration under section 12A or section 12AA, as the case may be; and</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;">8. Self-certified copy of order of rejection of application for grant of registration under section 12A or <a href="https://taxguru.in/income-tax/section-12aa-application-cannot-rejected-without-affording-opportunity-heard-assessee.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>section 12AA</strong></a>,as the case may be, if any.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Documents Required for 12A Registration</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The following documents must be submitted by the 12A registration applicant in Form 10A:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Certified copy of the instrument under which the trust/institution was created/established, if applicable</li>
<li>Certified copy of the document evidencing the creation of the trust or the establishment of the institution, if applicable</li>

<li>Certified copy of order of rejection of application for grant of registration under section 12A or section 12AA, if any.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Procedure for Obtaining&nbsp;12A Registration</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once, the application is submitted in the required format online, the Commissioner will request the applicant to submit additional information or documents, as the Commissioner sees fit. The request for additional information or documents would be to satisfy the Commissioner as to the genuineness of the activities of the Trust or Institution.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If the Commissioner is satisfied with the application, then he/she will pass an order in writing registering the Trust or Institution under 12A of the Income Tax Act. In case the Commissioner is not satisfied with the application, then he/she can also pass an order in writing refusing to register the Trust or Institution.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As per the provisions of Section 12AA(2), every order granting or refusing registration, shall be passed by the registering authority before the expiry of six months from the end of the month in which the application was received.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On average, 12A registration take 1 to 3 months in India. However, once a Trust obtains registration, its is valid for the lifetime of the Trust and there is no requirement for renewal.</p>

                      <h3><em>(1) Cancellation of Registration of a Trust or Institution under Section 12AA(3)</em></h3>
                      <p>As per section 12AA, the registration once granted to a trust or institution shall remain in force till it is cancelled by the Principal Commissioner or Commissioner. </p>
                      <p>Consequently, the Principal Commissioner or Commissioner can after giving reasonable opportunity of being heard to the concerned trust or institution, pass an order under section 12AA(3) in writing cancelling the registration under the following two circumstances:</p>
                      <ol type="a">
                        <li>
                          <p> the activities of a trust or institution are not genuine, or; </p>
                          </li>
                        <li>
                          <p> the activities are not being carried out in accordance with the objects of the trust or institution. </p>
                          </li>
                        </ol>
                      <p>Only if either or both the above conditions are met, would the Principal Commissioner/ Commissioner be empowered to cancel the registration, and not otherwise. </p>
                      <p>However, no order under section 12AA(3) shall be passed unless such trust or institution has been given a reasonable opportunity of being heard </p>
                      <h3><em>(2) Cancellation of Registration of a Trust or Institution under Section 12AA(4)</em></h3>
                      <p>The powers of Principal Commissioner/Commissioner to cancel registration under section 12AA(3) are severely restricted. There have been cases where trusts, particularly in the year in which they have substantial income claimed to be exempt under other provisions of the Income Tax Act, deliberately violate provisions of section 13 by investing in prohibited mode etc. Similarly, there have been cases where the income is not properly applied for charitable purposes or has been diverted for benefit of certain interested persons. Due to restrictive interpretation of the powers of the Principal Commissioner/ Commissioner under section 12AA, registration of such trusts or institutions continues to be in force and these institutions continue to enjoy the beneficial regime of exemption. </p>
                      <p>Whereas under section 10(23C), which also allows similar benefits of exemption to a fund, Institution, University etc, the power of withdrawal of approval is vested with the prescribed authority if such authority is satisfied that such entity has not applied income or made investment in accordance with provisions of section 10(23C) or the activities of such entity are not genuine or are not being carried out in accordance with all or any of the conditions subject to which it was approved. </p>
                      <p>Therefore, in order to rationalise the provisions relating to cancellation of registration of a trust, section 12AA(4) was inserted to provide that where a trust or an institution has been granted registration, and subsequently it is noticed that section 13(1) is applicable as its activities are being carried out in such a manner that,â€” </p>
                      <ol type="i">
                        <li>
                          <p> its income does not enure for the benefit of general public; </p>
                          </li>
                        <li>
                          <p> it is for benefit of any particular religious community or caste (in case it is established after commencement of the Income-tax Act); </p>
                          </li>
                        <li>
                          <p> any income or property of the trust is applied for benefit of specified persons like author of trust, trustees, etc.; or </p>
                          </li>
                        <li>
                          <p> its funds are invested in prohibited modes, </p>
