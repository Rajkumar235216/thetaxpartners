      Picking the right company structure for your business is as important as any other business-related activity. The right
business structure will allow your enterprise to operate efficiently and meet your required business targets. In India,
every business must register themselves as part of the mandatory legal compliance. Before we learn how to register a
company, let’s try and understand the types of business structures in India.<br>

&nbsp;
<h2 id="What"><strong>What are the types of business structures in India?</strong></h2><br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s try and understand the types of business structures available in India. Here is a
    list of some of them:</span><br>
<h3><b>1. One Person Company (OPC)</b></h3><br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Recently introduced in the year 2013, an OPC is the best way to start a company if there
    exists only one promoter or owner. It enables a sole-proprietor to carry on his work and still be part of the
    corporate framework.</span><br>
<h3><b>2. Limited Liability Partnership (LLP)</b></h3><br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A separate legal entity, in an LLP the liabilities of partners are only limited only to
    their agreed contribution.</span><br>
<h3><b>3. Private Limited Company (PLC)&nbsp;</b></h3><br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A company </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in the eyes of
    the law is regarded as a separate legal entity from its founders &nbsp;It has shareholders (stakeholders) and directors
    (company officers). Each individual is regarded as an employee of the company. </span><br>
<h3><strong>4. Public Limited Company (PLC)</strong></h3><br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"> A PLC is a voluntary association of members which is incorporated under company law. It
    has a separate legal existence and the liability of its members are limited to shares they hold.</span><br>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can choose what business structure suits your business needs best and accordingly
    register your business. </span><br>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is a comparative list of the popular business structures in India.</span><br>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Other forms of business structures include Sole proprietorship, Hindu Undivided Family,
    &nbsp;and Partnership firms. Please bear in mind, these structures do not come under the ambit of company
    law.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br>
<h2 id="Chitta"><strong>Why is it important to choose the right business structure?</strong></h2><br>
It is important to choose your business structure carefully as your Income Tax Returns will depend on it. While
registering your enterprise, remember that each business structure has different levels of compliances that need to be
met with. For example, a sole proprietor has to file only an income tax return. However, a company has to file an income
tax return as well as annual returns with the registrar of companies.<br>

A company’s books of accounts are to be mandatorily audited every year. Abiding by these legal compliances requires
spending money on auditors, accountants and tax filing experts. Therefore, it is important to select the right business
structure when thinking of company registration. An entrepreneur must have a clear idea of the kind of the legal
compliances he/she is willing to deal with.<br>

While some business structures are relatively investor-friendly than others, investors will always prefer a recognised
and legal business structure. For example, an investor may hesitate to give money to a sole proprietor. On the other
hand, if a good business idea is backed by a recognised legal structure (like LLP, Company, etc) the investors will be
more comfortable making an investment.<br>
<h2 id="How"><strong>How to choose a business structure while applying for company registration in India?</strong></h2>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s take a look at some important questions every entrepreneur must ask himself before
    he/she finally decide upon a business structure.</span><br>

<b>i. How many owners/partners will your business have?</b><br>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are a single person who owns the entire initial investment required for the
    business, a &nbsp;One Person Company would be ideal for you. On the other hand, if your business has two or more owners
    and is actively seeking investment from other parties a Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) or Private Limited
    Company would suit you best. &nbsp;</span><br>

<b>ii. Should your initial investment determine your choice of business structure?</b><br>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The answer to that question is – Yes if you want to spend less initially, it would be
    wise to go in for a Sole Proprietor, or a HUF or a Partnership. But, if you are sure that you will be able to
    recover the setup and compliance costs, you can opt for a One Person Company, LLP or a Private Limited
    Company</span><br>

<b>iii. Willingness to bear the entire liability of the business</b><br>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Business structures like sole proprietor, HUF, and partnership firm have unlimited
    liability. This means, in case of any default in loans, the entire money will be recovered from the members or
    partners in profit sharing ratio. The risk to personal assets is high in these cases.</span><br>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Whereas, Companies and LLPs have a limited liability clause. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">means that the liability of its members is
    restricted to the amount of contribution made by them or the value of shares each member holds.</span><br>

<b>iv. Income Tax Rates Applicable to businesses</b><br>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The income tax rates applicable to a sole proprietorship and a HUF are the normal slab
    rates. In case of a sole proprietorship, the business income is clubbed with the individual’s other
    income.</span><br>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But in the case of other entities like partnership and company a tax rate of 30% is
    applicable.</span><br>

<b>v. Plans of getting money from investors</b><br>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As mentioned earlier, it is difficult to get investments when your business structure is
    unregistered. Entities like LLP and Private Limited Company are trusted when it comes to investment. Make sure you
    choose the right structure, seek the help of an expert so that you register under proper guidance.</span><br>
<h2 id="Register"><strong>4. How to Register a Company in India?</strong></h2><br>
