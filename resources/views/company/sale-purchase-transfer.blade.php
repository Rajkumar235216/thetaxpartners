            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Check whether the Articles of Association
                    allows you for transfer of shares, if not then amend the articles by passing special resolution in

                    quote a time limit within which the members can purchase the shares. If within the time limit no
                    member comes to purchase the shares then the shares will be offered to an outsider and if the
                    outsider accepts the shares then the company will have to accept the transfer. The price of the
                    shares is finalized by the directors or the auditors of the company.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Step 4.</strong></span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Obtain the Share transfer deed in form SH-4
                    duly executed by both the transferor and transferee. The transfer deed should bear stamps according
                    to the Indian Stamp Act and Stamp Duty Notification. The present rate of transfer of shares is 25
                    Paise for every one hundred rupees of the value of shares or part. Cancel the stamps affixed at the
