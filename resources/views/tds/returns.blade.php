        <p><strong>Tax Deducted at Source</strong> or <strong>TDS</strong> is a source of collecting tax by Government
            of India at the time when a transaction takes place. Here, the tax is required to be deducted at the time
            money is credited to the payee’s account or at the time of payment, whichever is earlier.</p>
        <p>In case of payment of salary or life insurance policy, tax is deducted at the time of payment. The deductor
            then deposits this TDS amount to the Income Tax (I-T) department. Through TDS, some portion of your tax is
            automatically paid to the I-T department. Thus, TDS is considered as a method of reducing tax evasion.</p>
        <p>Tax is deducted usually over a range of 1% to 10%.</p>

        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Form 27A contains a control chart whose all columns must be filled. This form is then verified in hard
                copy form with the e-TDS return filed electronically.</li>

            <li>The assessees are required to mention their Tax Deduction Account Number (TAN) in Form No. 27A. This is
                similar to what is done in case of e-TDS return. This is dictated by ‘sub-section (2) of section 203A of
                the I-T Act in India’.</li>

                follow. This is because it brings consistency and better understanding in filling the forms. It is

                available at NSDL website known as Return Prepare Utility (e-TDS RPU Light) for filing the return
                online. It is important to ensure that the online TDS file formats come with ‘txt’ as the filename
                extension.</li>
            <li>The physical returns are submitted at any TIN-FC’s managed by NSDL. TIN-FC’s are found at specified
                areas across the country.</li>
            <li>If returns are filed online, then they can be submitted directly at NSDL TIN website. In this case, the
                deductor has to sign the return through digital signature.</li>
            <li>While submitting the return, if all the information mentioned is accurate then a provisional
                receipt/token number would be issued. This provisional receipt/token number is considered as an
                acknowledgment, stating the fact that the return has been filed. In case, the return is not accepted,
                then a non-acceptance memo will be issued along with the reasons for rejections.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><strong>Validation of the TDS Return File</strong></h3>
        <p>The procedure for the validation of TDS return file is given below:</p>
        <ul>

            <li>The tool is available on NSDL website for free</li>
            <li>In case any error is found in the file, FVU will provide a report for the same</li>
            <li>Make the necessary changes and verify the file again through the FVU</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><strong>Penalty for delay in filing TDS Return</strong></h3>

            Rs 200 per day shall be paid by the assessee until the time the default continues. However, the total
            penalty should not exceed the TDS amount.</p>
        <h3><strong>Non-filing of TDS Return</strong></h3>
        <p>If an assessee has not filed the return within 1 year from the due date of filing return or if a person has
            furnished incorrect information, he/she shall also be liable for penalty. The penalty levied should not be
            less than Rs 10,000 and not more than Rs 1,00,000.</p>
        <h3><strong>TDS Return Preparation Utility</strong></h3>

        <ul>
            <li>Revised TDS return can be filed only if the original TDS return is accepted by the TIN central system.
            </li>
            <li>The assessee can check the status of the TDS return filed online by providing required details, such as
                PAN number and Provisional Receipt number/Token number on NSDL website <a
                    href="https://onlineservices.tin.egov-nsdl.com/TIN/JSP/tds/linktoUnAuthorizedInput.jsp"
                    rel="nofollow">https://onlineservices.tin.egov-nsdl.com/TIN/JSP/tds/linktoUnAuthorizedInput.jsp</a>
            </li>
            <li>Revised TDS return has to be prepared by using the most recent consolidated TDS statement. This can be
                downloaded from the TRACES website. For downloading this statement, the provisional receipt/token number
                of the original statement should be mentioned.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><strong>TDS Refund</strong></h3>
        <p>TDS is the tax amount deducted at the time of payment. At the year end, while assessing the total tax
            liability, there is a difference between the total tax deducted during the year and the actual tax
            liability. If the tax deducted at the source is less than the actual tax liability, then the difference
